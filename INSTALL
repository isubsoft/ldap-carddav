-- Composer
This project uses composer dependencies. Please install the dependencies by running composer update from web document root directory. This project is compatible with SabreDav 3.2 (PHP 5.5) till SabreDav 4.0.3 (PHP 7.0.0). VObject 4.5 (PHP 7.1) is required for some vCard v3.0 interoperability with vCard v4.0 for contact groups. You may adjust composer.json according to your need/environment.

-- Web server and PHP configuration

-- Server configuration file
1. Copy conf/conf.php.example as conf/conf.php and update conf/conf.php according to your environment.

-- Sync database creation
1. Create objects as per sql/<database_product>/ddl.sql file, any user (as required) and issue appropriate grants to the user in the PDO database.
   SQLite example: sqlite3 data/sync/pdo/sqlite/cards.db < sql/sqlite/ddl.sql
2. Update PDO DSN appropriately in $config['sync_database'] in conf/conf.php file.

2. Bind user used for reading/writing contacts in an address book as per conf file need to have read privileges on entryUUID, modifyTimestamp and createTimestamp operational attributes additionally and must have appropriate size limit and time limit. It is recommended to create a separate user for syncing contacts having only read privileges on entryUUID, modifyTimestamp and createTimestamp of the contacts and liberal or no size limit and time limit.

-- Download project
Download the project files from the repository and place the project folder in a path suitable to your HTTP server. The project folder path should be set as the document root in your HTTP server configuration file.

-- Go to the project folder path before performing any of the below steps.

-- Composer
This project uses composer dependencies. Please install the dependencies by running 'composer update'. This project is compatible with SabreDAV 3.2 (PHP 5.5) till SabreDAV 4.0.3 (PHP 7.0.0). VObject 4.5 (PHP 7.1) is required for some vCard v3.0 interoperability with vCard v4.0 for contact groups. You may adjust composer.json according to your need/environment.

-- Application conf file
Copy conf/conf.php.example as conf/conf.php and update the file conf/conf.php according to your environment and need. Configuration keys are documented along side in the conf/conf.php.example file. Check the wiki for more advanced configuration examples.

-- Sync database creation
1. Create objects as per sql/<database_product>/ddl.sql file and if required create a database user and issue appropriate grants to it.
   Example (sqlite): sqlite3 data/sync/syncdb/sqlite/cards.db < sql/sqlite/ddl.sql
2. Update 'dsn' and credentials appropriately in $config['sync_database'] in conf/conf.php file.
3. If creating a sqlite database make sure the database file is placed inside the data directory.

-- Initializing sync database
1. Make sure your address books are configured correctly in the conf file before you perform the next steps.
2. Execute 'php src/App/syncdb.php init' to initialize the sync database.

-- File permissions
1. conf/conf.php MUST NOT be world readable but MUST be readable and preferably not writable by the user executing PHP.
2. Data directory need to be writable by the user executing PHP and MUST NOT be world readable. All sub directories of data directory need to be writable by the user executing PHP. Default data directory is data.
3. Temporary files directory need to be writable by the user executing PHP unless system temporary files directory is configured. Default temporary files directory is tmp.

-- Web server and PHP configuration
Check the wiki for examples.

-- LDAP server
1. Operational attributes entryUUID, modifyTimestamp and createTimestamp need to be indexed for all contacts.
2. Bind user used for reading/writing contacts in an address book as per conf file need to have read privileges on entryUUID, modifyTimestamp and createTimestamp operational attributes additionally and must have appropriate size limit and time limit. It is recommended to create a separate user for syncing contacts having only read privileges on entryUUID, modifyTimestamp and createTimestamp of the contacts and liberal or no size limit and time limit. This sync user can be mentioned in 'sync_bind_user' and 'sync_bind_pw' of the address book configuration section in the conf file.
